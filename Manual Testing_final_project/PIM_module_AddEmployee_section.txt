API

How to authenticate

It's a Bearer token authentication
before you can use the API you need to create an OAuth client from the OrangeHRM web UI in Admin > Configuration > Register OAuth Client by giving it secure id and secret/password.
In order to authenticate, a POST request is fired to {your-host}/index.php/oauth/issueToken (in my case http://127.0.0.1/orangehrm-4.0/symfony/web/index.php/oauth/issueToken)
the request takes parameters client_id, client_secret, grant_type , where
client_id = [the oauth ID you've created]; client_secret = [the oauth secret you've created]; grant_type = 'client_credentials'

The response looks like {"access_token":"ecdc9f1c565ce501f25c7b9a1b17d4d254d35f50","expires_in":3600,"token_type":"bearer","scope":null}
now you can call the API with an Authorisation header: {[token_type] [access_token]} (e.g. Authorisation: "Bearer ecdc9f1c565ce501f25c7b9a1b17d4d254d35f50" at http://{your-host}/api/v1/*
